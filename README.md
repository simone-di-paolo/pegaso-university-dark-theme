# Pegaso University - Dark Theme

This is a .css stylesheet for who, like me, hate white pages.
Add the style into extensions that can inject .css in page (e.g. Stylus) et voilt√†!
You're in!

The following screenshot it's and example of the dark-theme:

<img src="resources/img/example.jpg" width="500">

It's still work in progress.
NB. I'm not a FE developer so, probably, it's the worst things you'll ever see on Github but... It works for now.
Feel free to fork/create PR in order to improve the style.

Cheers,
Simone
