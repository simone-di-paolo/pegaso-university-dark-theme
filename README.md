  <h3>PEGASO UNIVERSITY - DARK THEME</h3>

<p text-align="center">

  This is a .css stylesheet for who, like me, hate white pages.
  Add the style into extensions that can inject .css in page (e.g. Stylus) et voilt√†!
  You're in!

  The following screenshot it's and example of the dark-theme:

  It's still work in progress.
  NB. I'm not a FE developer so, probably, it's the worst things you'll ever see on Github but... It works for now.
  Feel free to fork/create PR in order to improve the style.

  Cheers,<br>
  Simone
